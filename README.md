# x265 HEVC Encoder - *DJATOM's Mod*
Main purpose of creating own mod is additional functionality that most likely will not be accepted to mainstream repo. Currently my mod contains such enchancements as 
- XLENGTH y4m tag support
- extended progress line, including elapsed/estimated remaining encode time, estimated file size, etc
- Vapoursynth scripts reader
